A simple Desktop code runner for Deno, made using
[ðŸ¦• Astrodon](https://github.com/astrodon/astrodon/tree/feature/deno_tauri)

**Note**: Astrodon is currently being developed, therefore, it is on alpha stage and it's missing some stuff. The version used on here is from Astrodon's `feature/deno_tauri` branch.
